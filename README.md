# Hello_World
My Codeup Repository

I'm currently working on developing my data science skills and learning from the Codeup Data Science program.

I am currently enrolled in Codeup's Data Science program, and after completing it, I plan to continue my studies in the Data Science Undergraduate program at Indiana University. Recently, I ended my 22-year commitment to the United States Air Force. As a technology enthusiast, I have found a passion for learning about Data Science, and I am eager to pursue it further.
